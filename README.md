## Git Based Change Log

This package generates a change log style report from git commits. Each tag is listed with its date and any commits included in it tagged with a certain string (!public or @public by default)

## Requirements

- PHP must be able to run exec().
- Git must be installed! You should probably have some tags as well...

##

## Code Example

    $changeLog = new MaxBrokman\GitChangeLog\ChangeLog( new MaxBrokman\GitChangeLog\Git );
    $log = $changeLog->getChangeLog( $page = 1 );


Will return something like

    [
        {
            "tag": "v1",
            "date": 1409965746, // utc time
            "changesSinceLastTag":
                [
                    {
                        "commit": "9e9125b", // Short commit hash
                        "author": "Max Brokman <max.brokman@gmail.com>",
                        "message": "Commit Message @public"
                    },
                ...
                ]
        },
        ...
    ]

## Installation

With composer, require


     "maxbrokman/git-change-log": "0.0.4"

## Use Case

I work on an internal project for a large company. Some of our stakeholders want to be kept informed about what is happening with the application.
We release several times a day, and this package allows us to provide a list within the application of what has been updated, without having to manually maintain a changelog.
We use **!public** in commit messages to mark them as safe for public (well in our case internal) consumption.

## API Reference

To change the pattern used to find public commit messages you may call `setPublicMarker( "grep pattern" )` on the instance of MaxBrokman\GitChangeLog\Git you pass to to ChangeLog


To change the number of results per page you may call `setPerPage( 100 )` on MaxBrokman\GitChangeLog\ChangeLog

## Tests

Tests are run using [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/ "PHPUnit"). Run `phpunit` from the root directory.

GitTest.php requires a git repo with a tag v0.0.1
